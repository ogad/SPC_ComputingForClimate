# Remote computing
Doing your work somewhere with more power and space.

## Why do remote computing?
The resources on your machine will leave you unable to do some parts of your work.
Maybe you'll need too much data in storage, need to load too much into memory, it would take too long on the computing power you have, or you need to analyse data securely stored elsewhere.
Essentially when you either have one "big job" to do, or you have to do lots and lots of small jobs (or the same job on lots of separate data!)

High performance computing (what we call "supercomputers") involves chaining together lots of separate computers into one big system, which lots of users can use at once.
Each computer in the system is called a node.
You can often connect to the system (via a "login node") and view/interact with the file system.
Resource-intensive jobs should never be run on the login nodesâ€”they slow down the system for everyone else.
For these jobs you should reserve resources using the batch system (or use a dedicated node for certain types of work on machines where they're provided).
The most important thing is to read the documentation for the system you're using and follow their instructions.
